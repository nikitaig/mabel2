### Wholesale Bulk Order Form [PRO]

The Bulk Bulk Order Form feature allows you to create a wholesale area exclusively for B2B users. So, wholesale customers can order products in bulk or create & save purchase lists to order them later. The bulk order form can be enabled on the customer's "My Account Page," or you can also create a separate bulk order page via shortcode.

### Private Store and WooCommerce Product Visibility Control

WholesaleX also allows you to hide your Wholesale store from guests and B2C users like an ideal WooCommerce Private store plugin. Either you can completely hide your entire store, or you can also hide the prices and encourage potential B2B users with the login message to view prices.

### WooCommerce Request a Quote [PRO]

WooCommerce Request a Quote is an exciting feature of the built-in conversation system of WholesaleX. So when the customers add any products to the cart, they will see a "Request a Quote" button. And when the potential customer sends any quote request, the store admin can negotiate with the buyer by sending a custom offer.

### WholesaleX Wallet [PRO]

WholesaleX also has a digital wallet system that can be used as a payment method. Customers can add funds to their wallets and then use them while purchasing products from your store. And as a store admin, you can also manually add funds to any registered customer's wallet.

### Subaccounts [PRO]

This feature allows the registered B2B customer to create subaccounts. So the subaccounts holder can place orders on behalf of the main account holder. The main account holder provides desired permission to subaccount holders to control what they can do and what they cannot.
